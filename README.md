This is a simple project I built while learning FastAPI, a modern web framework for building APIs with Python 3.13.3

I followed a tutorial to understand how to:

Set up a FastAPI project

Define routes using @app.get() and @app.post()

Use Swagger UI for testing endpoints

Run a FastAPI server with Uvicorn
